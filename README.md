# LENA_Scripts

These come from https://github.com/BergelsonLab/LENA_Scripts. Modified slightly to work with VIHI folder structure.
3/9/2021 -- EC needs to fork/branch repo

There are two .r  scripts in here. One helps get stuff out of your its files (``functions.r``) and one helps you  concatenate that for a directory of its files (``getting_lena_details_from_its``)

Data file contains the list of .its files to run the script over. 

Output .csv lives in SubjectFiles/LENA.
